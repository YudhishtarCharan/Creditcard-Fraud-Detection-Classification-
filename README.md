# Creditcard-Fraud-Detection-Classification-
Fraud detection on 8,000 European credit card transactions from Sept 2013, with 492 fraud cases. Data is highly imbalanced and mostly PCA-transformed (V1–V28), with raw ‘Time’ and ‘Amount’ fields. ‘Class’ marks fraud vs. legit transactions, supporting anomaly detection and cost-sensitive modeling.
